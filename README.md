Opening Scene
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Narrator:	"Meet Idle"

	<fade in to image of Idle sitting on the couch watching TV>

	Narrator:	"As you may have guessed from his name, Idle is in fact quite
				lazy."

				"Idle dropped the remote a few months ago, and has been watching
				the same channel ever since."

				"When Idle was born his mom gave him a normal name, like Bill or
				Gertrude, or Angus, or Kevin or .... well it's not important
				what it was. It is just important that it was normal. When she
				saw how lazy he was she went to the town hall and had it changed
				to Idle. He can walk to town hall and change it back any time he
				likes. He hasn't. For 18 years."

				"He is so lazy that he has food delivered by post rather than go
				to the shop down the street."

	<door bell rings>

	Mail Man:	"Mails here!"

	Idle:		"Meh, I ate a few days ago... I'll eat tomorrow"

	<The life meter drops by one>

	<The roller blinds on a window suddenly slip, and it rolls up revealing a
	sunny day outside. Time passes quickly and we see a whole day and night pass
	in a matter of seconds>

	Mail Man:	"Mails here!"

	Idle:		"I'm coming... I'm comin.... *snore*"

	<The life meter drops by one (only one remains)>

	<A day and night passes>

	Mail Man:	"Mails here!"

	Idle:		"Okay, okay. I'm up. I'm up."

	<Idle walks to the door slowly, steps outside and picks up some food from
	the mailbox. The life meter fills back up to full.>

	<Idle walks back to his door. It's locked!>

	<It starts to rain>

	<The player is now in control of Idle>



Game Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game is based around the incredible lengths that Idle must go to in order to
complete what would be simple tasks for a normal person. Idle is not a normal
person though. He is lazy.

The world, and all of the people in it move at too fast of a pace for Idle. He
just can't keep up.
