Idle
================================================================================

Idle is a game, about a very lazy boy named Idle.

Opening Scene
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Narrator:		Meet Idle

	<fade in to image of Idle sitting on the couch watching TV>

	Narrator:		As you may have surmised from his name, Idle is in fact
					rather lazy.

					Idle dropped the remote a few months ago, and has been
					watching the same channel ever since.

					When Idle was born his mom gave him a normal name, like Bill
					or Gertrude, or Angus, or Kevin or .... well it's not
					important what it was. It is just important that it was
					normal. When she saw how lazy he was she went to the town
					hall and had it changed to Idle. He can walk to town hall
					and change it back any time he likes.

					He hasn't. For 18 years.

	<door bell rings>

	Delivery Man:	I have a package for a Mr Idle.

	Idle:			Meh, leave it by the door. I'll get it later.

	<door bell rings>

	Cute Girl:		Hey Idle, do you want to go to the movies or something?

	Idle:			Sorry, I'm busy today. Maybe next week.

	Narrator:		It seems that nothing could convince Idle to move.

	<Loud banging on the door>

	Angry Panda:	Hey, you killed my brother! Get your sorry ass out here, and
					face me! I challenge you to a duel! I'm going to kill you!!!

	Idle Yells:		What? You have the wrong house!

	Angry Panda:	You're lying! You have exactly 5 seconds to get out here or
					I'll burn your house down with you in it!

	<Idle runs to the door>
	<Idle answers the door, clearly winded and trying to regain his breath>

	Narrator:		Perhaps Idle does have one useful trait. Cowardice.

	Angry Panda:	Wait a second... You look different. Did you change your
					hair?

	Idle:			No.

	Angry Panda:	Didn't you have a scar on the left side of your face?

	Idle:			No.

	Angry Panda:	Weren't you about 4 inches taller?

	Idle:			No.

	Angry Panda:	Weren't you a woman?

	Idle:			No.

	Angry Panda:	You aren't the one that killed my brother, are you?

	Idle:			No.

	Angry Panda:	Well, I'm glad we cleared that up. Would you like to have a
					duel anyway? Nothing gets your heart beating like a duel to
					the death!

	Idle:			No.

	Angry Panda:	Oh come on, you'll love it! It's fun!

	Idle:			Aren't you a member of an endangered species? Is it really a
					good idea for you to go around having duels to the death?

					While we're on the topic of death, should you be smoking?
					There are only a few thousand of you guys left...

	Angry Panda:	Whoa, get off my back. You sound like my mom! I'm outta
					here!

	<The wind picks up and blows the door shut, locking the door>

	<It starts to rain>

	<The player is now in control of Idle>



Game Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game is based around the incredible lengths that Idle must go to in order to
complete what would be simple tasks for a normal person. Idle is not a normal
person though. He is lazy.

The world, and all of the people in it move at too fast of a pace for Idle. He
just can't keep up.
