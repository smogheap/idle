Grandpa
================================================================================

The first character that Idle runs into is his grandfather, an ancient and frail
man, who walks with a walker. Grandpa appears to zip onto the screen very
quickly but it is actually just Idle who is moving slowly.

Once Idle meets additional characters it will become clear that Grandpa is
actually moving very slowly compared to everyone else. He just seems to be very
fast to Idle.

Appearance
================================================================================

Grandpa is a very frail and thin old man. He is constantly hunched over a walker
which he shuffles about while walking.

Grandpa is bald, and wears a plaid shirt with brown pants that are pulled up to
his nipples.

Personality
================================================================================

Grandpa will frequently make fun of Idle for being so lazy. He will make
comments like "I like your bathrobe. You'd fit in at my nursing home." or "My
buddy Marvin dresses a lot like you. He has an excuse though. He broke his hip."

Possible interactions with Idle
================================================================================

At various points Idle will likely need money, and may ask Grandpa to borrow
some cash. Grandpa will likely be very rude about it, and possibly make Idle
earn the money in strange ways.
