Recovering Zombie
================================================================================

This character (which we don't yet have a name for) is a recovering zombie. When
he first meets Idle he attempts to eat his brains. After all, Idle is easier to
catch than anyone else.

He starts talking to Idle though, and Idle is able to convince him not to eat
his brain.

Slowly, through many different interactions Idle is able to help this character
transition from a zombie back to a normal human. This process may include things
like taking him to an undead anonymous meeting, or helping him find a prosthetic
limb, etc.

Once this character has recovered he becomes a lawyer, and is able to help Idle
with legal troubles.
