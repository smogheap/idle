Angry Panda
================================================================================

I thought up the angry panda as a possible alternate introduction. I'm not
entirely happy with food as an explanation for why he leaves the house, so
instead perhaps fear is his reason.


Alternate Opening Scene
================================================================================

Narrator:		Meet Idle

<fade in to image of Idle sitting on the couch watching TV>

Narrator:		As you may have surmised from his name, Idle is in fact rather
				lazy.

				Idle dropped the remote a few months ago, and has been watching
				the same channel ever since.

				When Idle was born his mom gave him a normal name, like Bill or
				Gertrude, or Angus, or Kevin or .... well it's not important
				what it was. It is just important that it was normal. When she
				saw how lazy he was she went to the town hall and had it changed
				to Idle. He can walk to town hall and change it back any time he
				likes. He hasn't. For 18 years.

<door bell rings>

Delivery Man:	I have a package for a Mr Idle.

Idle:			Meh, leave it by the door. I'll get it later.

<door bell rings>

Cute Girl:		Hey Idle, do you want to go to the movies or something?

Idle:			Sorry, I'm busy today. Maybe next week.

Narrator:		It seems that nothing could convince Idle to move.

<Loud banging on the door>

Angry Panda:	Hey, you killed my brother! Get your sorry ass out here, and
				face me! I challenge you to a duel!

Idle Yells:		What? You have the wrong house!

Angry Panda:	You're lying! You have exactly 5 seconds to get out here or I'll
				burn your house down with you in it!

<Idle walks to the door>

Narrator:		Perhaps Idle does have one useful trait. Cowardice.

Angry Panda:	Wait a second. You look different then I remember. Didn't you
				have a scar on your face... and a peg leg... and weren't you 4
				inches taller... and female...

				You're not the guy that killed my brother, are you?

Idle:			No.

Angry Panda:	Would you like to have a duel anyway?

Idle:			No.

Angry Panda:	Are you sure? A duel to the death can be a lot of fun!

Idle:			Aren't you a member of an endangered species? Is it really a
				good idea for you to go around having duels to the death?

Angry Panda:	I know, I know... I should stop. Alright, I best be going. Sorry
				for the trouble.

<The wind picks up and blows the door shut>

<It starts to rain>

<Idle realizes he is locked out>

<The player is now in control of Idle>
