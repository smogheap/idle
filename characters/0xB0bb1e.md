0xB0bb1e
================================================================================

0xB0bb1e (or b0b for short) is a robot in denial. It is very clear that he is a
robot, yet he insists (very badly) that he is not.

In order to get b0b to help him Idle must help b0b come to terms with his
existence.

Appearance
================================================================================

0xB0bb1e is a very poorly constructed simple robot. His body consists of 2
wheels, a car battery, and old CRT television and a lot of wires and duct tape.

A face is displayed on the television screen when talking to b0b.
