Editor
================================================================================

Creating a world this large will require a graphical editor. The editor will run
in the browser and use the same renderer as the actual game.

Interface
================================================================================

A cursor will be moved around the screen much like a character would. It will
highlight the current tile, and allow it to be changed.

Tiles will be organized by group, and various other types. For example, there
will be a group of tiles called "fences" with types of "white", "old", etc.

A keystroke will be assigned to each tile group. An additional keystroke will
change the tile within the group or the type of the tile.

For example, grasses will be bound to g, fences to f, water to w, etc. If I
select a tile and hit f it will place a fence there. Hitting space will switch
to a different direction (ie which way it is facing). Hitting tab will switch
the style of the fence, etc
